# QuantAQ Particle Analysis

This folder contains analysis notebooks developed to explore particle
distribution and variability using QuantAQ sensor data.

These notebooks contain analysis workflows developed to examine air-quality
and particulate data collected from QuantAQ sensors deployed in museum environments.

## Notebooks
- **BinsStandarddeviation.ipynb**  
  Examines variability and dispersion across particle size bins.

- **Particlesdistribution.ipynb**  
  Explores particle distribution patterns and summary statistics.

## Data and Privacy
Raw sensor data, exports, and sensitive metadata are not included.
