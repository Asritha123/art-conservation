# Bumper Analysis

## Overview
This analysis investigates the degradation of polyurethane frame bumpers
observed on framed objects, with a focus on determining whether short-term
environmental conditions—particularly temperature—are a primary driver
of active bumper decay.

The work was conducted in coordination with conservation research and
preventive monitoring efforts.

  Identification of missing or irregular intervals relevant to interpreting
  environmental and HVAC-related data continuity.
## Analytical Approach
The analysis focused on environmental behavior rather than material testing.
Specifically, it examined:

- Rate of change in temperature over time to identify abrupt fluctuations
- Temporal stability of environmental conditions during periods of observed damage
- Comparison between affected spaces and adjacent rooms with similar conditions
- Identification of uncertainty or instability patterns that could indicate
  environmental stress

## Key Findings
- Rate-of-change analysis did not show sharp or anomalous temperature transitions
  that would explain the observed bumper degradation.
- Adjacent rooms with comparable environmental patterns did not exhibit
  corresponding bumper failure.
- Actively decaying bumpers did not align with periods of heightened
  environmental uncertainty or short-term instability.

These results indicate that temperature-driven environmental fluctuations
are unlikely to be the primary cause of bumper degradation.
